Use as the context expression of a `with` statement:

```pyconsole
>>> from harrison import Timer
>>> with Timer() as t:
>>>     ...
>>> print t.elapsed_time_ms
12345
```

When a description string is passed on initialization, the elapsed time will
be printed on completion, keyed by this description.

```pyconsole
>>> with Timer('My expensive block of code'):
>>>     ...
My expensive block of code: 12345 ms
```

You can also start and stop a Timer explicitly:

```py
timer = Timer()
timer.start()

some_expensive_function(...)
print timer.elapsed_time_s

another_expensive_function(...)
timer.stop()
print timer.elapsed_time_s
```

You can also time each execution of a function using a decorator:

```py
from harrison import profile

@profile('Describes the function')
def some_function():
    pass

# Without args, the function name (e.g. 'some_function') will be used
# as the description.
@profile()
def another_function():
    pass
```

You can also use `RegisteredTimer`, which groups together a bunch of named
timers, provides utilities for serializing their times, and an optional global
timer registry.

Named after John Harrison, the English carpenter and clockmaker who
invented the [marine chronometer][].
